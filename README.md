# Statistics Test Project 1

In this project we will use basic Python and statistical knowledge to analyze some movies ratings (2016-2017) to determine if an apparent problem in an online movie ratings aggregator called "Fandango" was already fixed after a data journalist (Walt Hickey) noticed that the website was rounding up the movie's ratings. The incident happened in october of 2016 and the website said it was not intentional and was caused by a bug and they would fix it.

Update: The goal of the analysis was changed to determine changes in the ratings of movies of 2015 and 2016.
